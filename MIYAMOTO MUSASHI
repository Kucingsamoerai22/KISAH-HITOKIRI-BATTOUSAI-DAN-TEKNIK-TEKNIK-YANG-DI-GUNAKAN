    <p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;font-size:17px;">Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵), or simply Musashi, was a very famous samurai and ronin in medieval Japan. He is thought to have been born around 1584, and died in 1645. His real name was Shinmen Takezo. The word Musashi is another pronunciation of "Takezo" (kanji letters can have many pronunciations and meanings). Musashi has the full name Shinmen Musashi No Kami Fujiwara No Genshin.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Origin of descent</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;font-size:17px;">Musashi's childhood nickname was Bennosuke. The name Miyamoto itself is the ancient name of an area southwest of Tokyo. The name No Kami means the local nobility. In general, Fujiwara is the name of the ancestral family of the nobles in Japan which was passed down thousands of years ago. The ancestors of the Musashi family (Hirada/Hirata) were descendants of the Shinmen family, the rulers of Kyushu, the southern island of Japan.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Childhood </h1>
    <hr>
   <p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;font-size:17px;">Musashi's father, Munisai Hirata , died when he was probably only 7 years old. After his mother also died, Musashi went to live with his maternal uncle. Thus, he was an orphan when Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified Japan in 1590. It is unclear whether his desire to play Kendo was due to his uncle's influence or Musashi's own desire.</p>
   <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Various fights </h1>
   <p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;font-size:17px;">Musashi's first enemy was Arima Kihei , a Shinto Ryu samurai in the military arts who was skilled in using swords and spears. Musashi defeated him by throwing him to the ground and hitting him with a stick, causing his enemy to die covered in blood.
    When he was 16, Musashi defeated his next opponent, and from then on he ran away from home and engaged in various fighting contests and wars until he was 50. Musashi wandered around Japan and became a legend. He defeated many famous enemies, including the samurai of the Yoshioka family in Kyoto , the famous stick master Muso Gonosuke in Edo , the Matsudaira nobleman in Izumo , and Sasaki Kojiro in Bunzen .

    Another battle was a battle against one of the famous martial arts schools in Japan at that time in Ichijoji. Musashi fought against about 50 samurai, and the battle was won by Miyamoto Musashi with his two sword technique. Until now, the remains of Musashi's battle in Ichijoji have been used as a monument by the Japanese people.
    One of the most famous battles that Musashi is often said to have been involved in was the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 , between the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu and forces supporting the government of Toyotomi Hideyori , in which thousands were killed in the battle itself and the subsequent massacre by the victorious army. Musashi sided with the forces of Toyotomi Hideyori (son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi).</p>
